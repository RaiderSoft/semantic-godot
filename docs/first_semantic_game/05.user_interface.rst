The User Interface
==================

In this section, we will set up the user interface and write a script that updates the user
interface based on the ``ChatPlayer`` node set up in the previous section. We'll also need to make
a new main scene to handle the connection between the level scene (already created) and the UI. By
the end of this section, we should be able to do the following from the user interface:

* See a constantly updated control hint message.
* See when other ``ChatAgents`` are nearby.
* Start and end a conversation with a nearby ``ChatAgent``.
* Write, send, and receive messages while in a conversation.

Part 1: Adjusing ChatPlayer
---------------------------

Before we start on the UI, we first need to adjust the ``ChatPlayer`` script that we created in the
last section. Right now it just prints messages out to console, but we'd like for it to instead
emit signals that can be picked up by the user interface. We'll also add in a ``_controlHint``
property that will be used to notify the player of possible interactions.

Emitting Signals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, let's declare the signals used to notify the UI of updates/changes. There will be six of
these.

.. code-block:: csharp

    // Signals for connecting to the UI
    [Signal]
    public delegate void ControlHintUpdatedEventHandler(string controlHint);
    [Signal]
    public delegate void ChatEntityAddedEventHandler(ChatEntity chatEntity);
    [Signal]
    public delegate void ChatEntityRemovedEventHandler(ChatEntity chatEntity);
    [Signal]
    public delegate void ConvoStartedEventHandler();
    [Signal]
    public delegate void ConvoEndedEventHandler();
    [Signal]
    public delegate void MsgAddedEventHandler(ChatEntity sender, string msg);

Next, we can rework the functions that we wrote earlier. Instead of notifying the player by
printing to the console, we'll emit a signal that will be picked up by the UI and displayed to the
player. So everywhere we have ``GD.Print()`` statements, we'll instead use ``EmitSignal()``.

1. Inside the method ``OnChatEntityEntered()`` write:

.. code-block:: csharp

    // Emit a signal that a new ChatEntity was added (for UI)
    EmitSignal(SignalName.ChatEntityAdded, enteringChatEntity);

1. Inside ``OnChatEntityExited()`` write:

.. code-block:: csharp

    // Emit a signal that a new ChatEntity was removed (for UI)
    EmitSignal(SignalName.ChatEntityRemoved, exitingChatEntity);

1. Inside ``StartConvo()`` write:

.. code-block:: csharp

        // Emit a signal that a conversation was started (for UI)
        EmitSignal(SignalName.ConvoStarted);

1. Inside ``EndConvo()`` write:

.. code-block:: csharp

        // Emit a signal that a conversation was ended (for UI)
        EmitSignal(SignalName.ConvoEnded);

1. Inside ``SendMsg()`` write:

.. code-block:: csharp

        // Emit a signal that there is a new message (for UI)
        EmitSignal(SignalName.MsgAdded, this, msg);

1. And inside ``ReceiveMsg()`` write:

.. code-block:: csharp

        // Emit a signal that there is a new message (for UI)
        EmitSignal(SignalName.MsgAdded, _inConvoWith, msg);

Control Hints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**[EXPAND]** The ``_controlHint`` property:

.. code-block:: csharp

    // The current control hint
    private string _controlHint;

**[EXPAND]** The ``_Process()`` method used to keep it updated:

.. code-block:: csharp

    // Called every tick
    public override void _Process(double delta)
    {
        // Update the control hint
        string newControlHint = "Use the arrow keys to move";
        if (InConvo())
        {
            newControlHint = "Press ESC to end the conversation";
        }
        else
        {
            ChatEntity nearestChatEntity = NearestChatEntity();
            if (nearestChatEntity != null)
                newControlHint = "Press SHIFT to talk with " + nearestChatEntity.ChatName;
        }
        if (newControlHint != _controlHint)
        {
            _controlHint = newControlHint;
            EmitSignal(SignalName.ControlHintUpdated, _controlHint);
        }
    }

Part 2: The User Interface Scene
--------------------------------

Setting Up the Scene
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The user interface scene is provided premade in a zip file. Download the file and extract the
contents into a folder called "user_interface". You should see the following files:

* *info_label.tscn*
* *info_style.tres*
* *NewMsgEdit.cs*
* *user_interface.tscn*
* *v_scroll_container.tscn*

Double-click on *user_interface.tscn* to open up the main scene for the user interface. You should
see a scene made up of various control nodes that has three main sections labeled "Control Hint",
"Nearby Entities", and "Messages". These sections correspond to the nodes ``ControlHintGroup``,
``EntityGroup``, and ``MsgGroup`` with their children.

Writing the Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, we'll add the main script for interacting with the UI. It will be attached to the root node
of the scene (``UserInterface``) and will listen for signals from the ``ChatPlayer`` node and update
it when necessary.

Add a C# script to the UserInterface node. Save the script as "UserInterface.cs".

**Properties**

First, we'll add a property that will reference the ``ChatPlayer`` node attached to the
*seraphis.tscn* scene. We won't worry about setting it from inside the UI script and will instead
have it set by the main scene (up next).

.. code-block:: csharp

    // A reference to the ChatPlayer node (will be set by dependency injection via Main.cs)
    public ChatPlayer MyChatPlayer;

Next, we'll add properties that will hold references to the various child nodes of the
UI scene. This will make them easier to access from the code. (These will have values assigned to
them later in the ``_Ready()`` method.)

.. code-block:: csharp

    // Various nodes that will need to be updated during gameplay
    private Label _controlHintInfo;
    private VBoxContainer _entityBox;
    private ScrollContainer _msgScroll;
    private VBoxContainer _msgBox;
    private TextEdit _newMsgEdit;
    private Button _newMsgSend;

We'll also have a property that will reference the *info_label.tscn* scene that we made earlier.
This will be used to add labels dynamically for nearby entities and messages.

.. code-block:: csharp

    // Scenes that will need to be instanced during gameplay
    private PackedScene _infoLabelScene = GD.Load<PackedScene>("res://user_interface/info_label.tscn");

The last property that we'll have is a flag to indicate whether a new message has just been added
to the UI. This will be used to help us keep the messages' scroll container scrolled all the way to
the bottom so that the newest messages are always visible.

.. code-block:: csharp

    // Flag for when a message has been added to the message box and so we need to scroll to end
    private bool _msgBoxHasNewMsg = false;

**Methods**

Now on to methods. First we'll override the node's ``_Ready()`` method. In this method, we'll
assign nodes to the properties declared earlier and we'll connect up a method to handle what
happens when the send button is pressed. We'll also call a helper function
``ConnectPlayerSignals()`` that connects all the relevant signals of ``ChatPlayer`` to methods in
this script. (Note: We use ``CallDeferred()`` here so that we can be sure ``ChatPlayer`` has been
loaded in the scene and ``MyChatPlayer`` has been set to reference it before we try to access it.)

.. code-block:: csharp

    // Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
    public override void _Ready()
    {
        // Get all the various child nodes
        _controlHintInfo = GetNodeOrNull<Label>("ControlHintGroup/InfoLabel");
        _entityBox = GetNodeOrNull<VBoxContainer>("EntityGroup/VScrollContainer/VBoxContainer");
        _msgScroll = GetNodeOrNull<ScrollContainer>("MsgGroup/VScrollContainer");
        _msgBox = GetNodeOrNull<VBoxContainer>("MsgGroup/VScrollContainer/VBoxContainer");
        _newMsgEdit = GetNodeOrNull<TextEdit>("MsgGroup/HBoxContainer/TextEdit");
        _newMsgSend = GetNodeOrNull<Button>("MsgGroup/HBoxContainer/Button");

        // Connect to the send message button (and propogate the signal)
        if (_newMsgSend != null)
            _newMsgSend.Pressed += OnNewMsgSendPressed;
        
        // Connect to the signals of the ChatPlayer
        CallDeferred("ConnectPlayerSignals");
    }

    // Connects to the various signals of the currently registered ChatPlayer
    private void ConnectPlayerSignals()
    {
        MyChatPlayer.ControlHintUpdated += SetControlHint;
        MyChatPlayer.ChatEntityAdded += AddEntity;
        MyChatPlayer.ChatEntityRemoved += RemoveEntity;
        MyChatPlayer.ConvoStarted += EnableNewMsg;
        MyChatPlayer.ConvoEnded += DisableNewMsg;
        MyChatPlayer.MsgAdded += AddMsg;
    }

Next, we'll override the node's ``_Process()`` method. In this method, if a new message has just
arrived, we'll make sure the ScrollContainer is scrolled all the way to the bottom.

.. code-block:: csharp

    // Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
    public override void _Process(double delta)
    {
        // Check if a new message has been added to the message box and scroll if needed
        if (_justAddedNewMsg)
        {
            _msgScroll.ScrollVertical = Mathf.RoundToInt(_msgScroll.GetVScrollBar().MaxValue);
            _justAddedNewMsg = false;
        }
    }

Next, write a method that handles setting the text of the "Control Hint" section.

.. code-block:: csharp

    // Set the text of the control hint label
    public void SetControlHint(string controlHint)
    {
        _controlHintInfo.Text = controlHint;
    }

Also, write the following methods for adding or removing an entity from the "Nearby Entities"
section. When adding an entity, we'll need to create a new instance of *info_label.tscn* and add it
as a child in the appropriate place. When removing, we'll need to search through all the ``Labels``
and find the one that matches the entity we are trying to remove.

.. code-block:: csharp

    // Add a ChatEntity to the entity box
    public void AddEntity(ChatEntity newEntity)
    {
        // Add the new entity to the box
        Label newEntityLabel = _infoLabelScene.Instantiate<Label>();
        newEntityLabel.Text = newEntity.ChatName;
        _entityBox.AddChild(newEntityLabel);
    }

    // Remove a ChatEntity from the entity box
    public void RemoveEntity(ChatEntity oldEntity)
    {
        string entityString = oldEntity.ChatName;

        // Look through all the entities in the box
        foreach (Node child in _entityBox.GetChildren())
        {
            // If we find the entity, remove it and exit
            if (child is Label entityLabel && entityLabel.Text == entityString)
            {
                entityLabel.QueueFree();
                break;
            }
        }
    }

The next method will determine what happens when the send button is pressed (or when the enter key
is pressed). We just need to call the SendMsg function of the ``ChatPlayer`` node.

.. code-block:: csharp

    // Called when the send button is pressed
    public void OnNewMsgSendPressed()
    {
        MyChatPlayer.SendMsg(_newMsgEdit.Text);
        _newMsgEdit.Text = "";
    }

The following two methods are for enabling and disabling text input and button presses in the UI.
They will be enabled when the player is in a conversation and disabled when they are not.

.. code-block:: csharp

    // Enable the controls for typing and sending a new message
    public void EnableNewMsg()
    {
        // Enable controls
        _newMsgEdit.Editable = true;
        _newMsgSend.Disabled = false;

        // Put focus on the text editor
        _newMsgEdit.GrabFocus();
    }

    // Disable the controls for typing and sending a new message
    public void DisableNewMsg()
    {
        // Disable controls
        _newMsgEdit.Editable = false;
        _newMsgSend.Disabled = true;

        // Release focus
        _newMsgEdit.ReleaseFocus();
        _newMsgSend.ReleaseFocus();
    }

The last method to write will allow us to add new chat messages to the UI. We'll need to create a
new instance of the *info_label.tscn* scene and add it as a child in the appropriate place. Also,
we'll want to set ``_justAddedNewMsg`` flag to true so that it will scroll to the new message.

.. code-block:: csharp

    // Add a ChatMsg to the message box
    public void AddMsg(ChatEntity sender, string msg)
    {
        // Add the new message to the box
        Label newMsgLabel = _infoLabelScene.Instantiate<Label>();
        newMsgLabel.Text = sender.ChatName + ": " + msg;
        _msgBox.AddChild(newMsgLabel);

        // Make sure we will scroll to the new message
        _justAddedNewMsg = true;
    }

Part 3: The Main Scene
----------------------

Now we will create the main scene that will bring the level and the UI together.

Setting Up the Scene
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a new scene and add an ``HSplitContainer`` as the root node. Rename the node to "Main" and
save the scene. Using an ``HSplitContainer`` allows us to resize the width of the user interface.
Set the following property:

* Control > Layout > Anhors Preset = "Full Rect"

Add a ``SubViewportContainer`` as a child of the ``Main`` node. Then add a ``SubViewport`` as a child
of the ``SubViewportContainer``. Set the following properties for the ``SubViewportContainer``:

* SubViewportContainer > Stretch = On (checked)
* Control > Layout > Container Sizing > Horizontal = Expand (checked)

Add a ``MarginContainer`` as a child of the ``Main`` node (below the ``SubViewportContainer``). This is
used to add a margin around the user interface so that it has some separation from the edge of the
window. Set the following properties:

* Control > Theme Overrides > Constants > Margin Top = 12
* Control > Theme Overrides > Constants > Margin Right = 12
* Control > Theme Overrides > Constants > Margin Bottom = 12

Finally, we can add the level and UI scenes. Instantiate ``level.tscn`` as a child of the
``SubViewport``, and instantiate ``user_interface.tscn`` as a child of the ``MarginContainer``.

Writing the Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you remember, our UI script has a property that is meant to point to the ChatPlayer node. Rather
than having the UI script set that property itself, we'll have our ``Main`` node do so by dependency
injection.

Add a C# script to the ``Main`` node. Save the script as "Main.cs". In this script, we'll just need to
override the ``_Ready()`` method with the following code. This code searches in the ``SubViewport``
for a ``ChatPlayer`` node called "ChatPlayer". It then gets the UI node and sets the ``MyChatPlayer`` property of
the UI to point to the ``ChatPlayer`` node that was found.

.. code-block:: csharp

    // Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
    public override void _Ready()
    {
        // Connect the UI up to the first ChatPlayer found
        ChatPlayer chatPlayer = GetNode("SubViewportContainer/SubViewport").FindChild("ChatPlayer") as ChatPlayer;
        UserInterface userInterface = GetNode<UserInterface>("MarginContainer/UserInterface");
        userInterface.MyChatPlayer = chatPlayer;
    }
