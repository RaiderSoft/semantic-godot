Generate a children's fantasy limerick related to the subject of {{ $subject }}. 
The limerick should not only rhyme, it should also make sense and maintain continuity. The limerick should tell a story or describe a character.

- Use grade school vocabulary, particularly for the last word of the limerick. 
- Make the last word very predictable and not at all creative.
- Respond with just the limerick and no other text. 

The limerick must make sense in the context of the Dungeons and Dragons 5E universe and not violate any of the Forgotten Realms lore.

Examples of Bad Limericks
=========================

There once was a fish in a river,
Whose scales would all shimmer and quiver.
He'd leap with a splash,
In a joyous dash,
Spreading magic as the best giver.

This limerick does not make any sense. The best giver?

---

There once was a river so wide,
Where creatures of magic reside.
With a whispering breeze,
And rustling trees,
It flowed with a mystical tide.

Rivers do not have tides. Oceans have tides.

---

For the riddle bank: In a castle, hidden from sight,
Lived vampires who loved the night.
With a cloak and a grin,
They'd invite you in,
Then vanish in the moonlight's light.

The moonlight's light?! No one would say that.

---

In a world where the magic's quite real,
Familiars have a special appeal.
With a purr, bark, or tweet,
Their magic's so neat,
And they help their wizards to heal.

This is a good limerick, but it does not make sense in the context of Dungeons and Dragons 5E. Familiars don't usually heal.

---

In a forest as day took its leave,
Dusk elves danced in the soft evening weave.
With a twirl and a bow,
Under the moon's gentle glow,
They vanished, as stars took their eve.

bow does not rhyme with glow!!!! This is NOT a limerick.
Stars took their eve? It doesn't make sense either.

---

In the twilight, as day took its leave,
Dusk elves danced, as if to deceive.
With a twirl and a spin,
In the soft, dimming din,
They vanished, as stars start to weave.

This version is better because spin rhymes with din, but no one would guess that stars weave. This is a bad limerick.

---

In a forest, shrouded in fog,
Lived a gnome with his faithful dog.
With a wave of his hand,
And a command so grand,
They'd vanish, just like a mirage.

mirage does not rhy with fog or dog. This is not a limerick.

Examplse of Good Limericks
==========================

In a garden enchanted and grand,
A wizard with green, leafy hand,
Cultivated vines,
In magical designs,
And danced with the trees in his land.

This is good because grand != hand != land, and land is predictable.

---

For the riddle bank: There once was a river so clear,
Where mermaids would often appear.
With a flip of their tail,
And a shimmering veil,
They'd vanish, leaving wonder and cheer.

Same as above. Cheer fits the rhyme scheme and it makes sense with the content of the poem.

---

In a castle, hidden from sight,
Lived vampires who loved the night.
With a cloak and a fang,
They'd start with a bang,
And disappear at first light.

A better version of the bad example above. A simple last word that makes sense.

---

In a meadow, under the sun's glance,
Grew a garden of plants in a trance.
With petals so bright,
In the soft morning light,
They woke up and started to dance.

I think what I am honing in on here is that the last line should be predictable, especially the last word.
I love this one.

---

There once was a knight, brave and bold,
With a sword that was bloody and old.
He'd fight with a roar,
On every shore,
Defending the weak, we are told.

Beautiful! Subject was "bloody swords"
